# Trees
* vEB trees
- contains implementation of insertion, deletion, minimum element, maximum element
- Supports multiple values
- Can find wether an element is present in tree or not and if yes returns its count
* RED-BLACK Tree
- Insert, Delete, Extract minimum and various other functions
* AVL Treee
- Insert, Delete, Kth-Minimum, Search.
* Kruskal 
- simple implemntation of Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.
- Used for comparision of performance of above mentioned data structures.
- Input (Number of vertices and Number of Edges)
- Algorithm will generate graph with above specs randomly and then compute MST of the graph using
  various data structures.
- It then prints the result and time taken

# Observations
- with increasing the number of edges vEB trees perform much better than other trees.
